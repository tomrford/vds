Read docs/spec.md for the full project specification and task list. Read status.md for previous work and memory.

Pick the most important incomplete task (follow the phase order in the spec) and work on it. Run the full quality gate (typecheck, lint, tests) after each change. If you learn something important for future work, add it to status.md Memory section. Commit when done (conventional commits).

Once finished, overwrite summary.md with a one-line summary.

If all tasks across all phases complete, set Status to 'Done'. If stuck on something impossible, set Status to 'Blocked'.
